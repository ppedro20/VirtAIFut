# VirtAIFut
Objective: detect the positions of players and the ball from broadcast images using Artificial Intelligence. Based on this data, a representation of the soccer field should be generated, showing the evolution of plays in real time and predicting the movement of players and the ball to improve the accuracy of the virtual representation of the elements.
